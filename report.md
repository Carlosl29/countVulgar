###What is the worst thing possible in the music industry?

It’s 1956, and a young man is performing one of his chart topping hits live on national television on “The Milton Berle Show”.  The whole country of USA goes crazy, with television critics claiming the performance was despicable due to it’s “appalling lack of musicality”, it’s “vulgarity” and “animalism”.  <space for picture of Elvis> Even the church had something to say, sending out a headline, “Beware Elvis Presley”.  The young man, Elvis Presley, had performed on live television and did something that was obscene at the time, move his hips back and forth.  He would go on to become one of the most influential artist in American music history. 

A couple years later, a new band comes to the world stage and enchants millions with their nitty gritty musical lyrics, ecstatic onstage presence, and do what they want lifestyle.  While other bands tried to keep their public image as clean as they could, these guys didn’t care what their fans thought about their way of living, in which they abuse alcohol, marijuana, heroin, and a whole host of other drugs.  The Rolling Stones would turn out to be a controversial band, with many believing them to be devil worshipers, that would last the test of time all the way into the modern day.<space for sympathy for the devil picture>

Flash forward to more recent trends in music, and you have songs with explicit language, about all kinds of sex, killing others, doing drugs, idealising women, etc putting to shame with songs of years prior have said within the lyrics.  Not just any music but many of the top billboard hits that garnered plenty of airplay on the radio.  The public seems to have gone complacent with the taboo ideas of years before.

Me and my co-researcher decided to look into the music industry to try and find out if there was an actual increase in raunchy, adulterated themes in the most popular music.  In order to have an actual measurement of any possible change we settled on analysing the frequency of profanity and curse words.  To us it seemed that there had to have been some sort of increase in explicit songs becoming popular, because if you listen to a song from 1965 and a song from 2015, it is evident that there is a difference in the subtleties of old genres and the straightforward approach of today's top hits.

###So what did you guys find out?
Well, from the initial data we gathered we were wrong. I'm talking about the time span from 2000 - 2015, in which we had the full lyrics of each top ten song of every year.  This was surprising because out of the 150 songs we assumed that more swear words would appear in the later years because of the increase of rap artists that have become more mainstream than ever before.  Thought there was an increase in swear words in that time span there was not much of a difference in use.  The increase can even be attributed to an increase in songs being published that include more swear word than usual.

After we got the results back from that range of years, we thought about it and chose to scan songs from a larger range, even though our data showed we were wrong.  

Just to note though we originally thought of the first range of years was because it was small enough of a range that we could copy each songs full lyrics into a text file.  We ran into a problem with getting the api to download all of the lyrics for each song that was in our list.  Musixmatch was the best source we found for getting the 

Curse words are as old as the english language, and so have become a,although controversial, large part of American culture.  Many believe that profanity is the worst kind of language that can be used, due to it’s aggressive meaning and negative connotations.  The crutch of the inarticulate, the weapon of the uneducated, are just some of the descriptions given to swearing.  The way in which we use language gives other people a look into what kind of person we are and what is our character. In other words if a person uses explicit language, his peers look at him as a person that has lazy speech due to the fact that he can not come up with anything more creative.  Even the bible has various quotes stating not to use foul language.  On the opposite side of the argument are those that believe that there is absolutely nothing wrong with cursing and it’s a very useful part of the english language.  Their thinking is that curse words have a use in giving a sentence or thought an extra punch that makes whatever point that is trying to be explained more emphasized. According to a study done in New Zealand in 2004
